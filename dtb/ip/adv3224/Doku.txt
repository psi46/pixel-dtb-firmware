ADV3224-IP Register-Definition
==============================

WRITE
-----
Reg 0-7 (8 Bit): Set Output <Reg-Number>
	- values 0-15: choose input <value> for according output (value will be saved in IP)
	- value  16:   deactivate output (default after reset)
	- value  255:  update all outputs to new values (write saved values into adv3224)

READ
----
Reg 0 (8 Bit): LSB remains high while IP is busy with programming ADV3224. Always check bevor writing 255 into a reg


Parameters
==========

divider: clk-divider from nios-clk to shift-clk


Idea
====

Set every output to the according input (write value in accoring reg). Then write 0xFF into a random reg (doesn't affect content) and wait until Reg 0 LSB goes low again.
