<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "lpm_counter1.vhd" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of lpm_counter megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "lpm_counter1.vhd". The design "lpm_counter1.vhd" is a 4 bit up modulus 10 counter. The counter has a synchronous clear input. </P>
